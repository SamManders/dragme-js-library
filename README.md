With the DrageMe JavaScript library you can make an element draggable with the mouse.

How to use the library:
1. Load in the JavaScript code (preferably in an external file)
2. Give the element you want to drag the class 'dragme'
3. Make sure the position of the element is set to 'position: relative;'
4. Enjoy dragging!
